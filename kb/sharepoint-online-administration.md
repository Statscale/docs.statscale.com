# SharePoint Online Administration

If you manage an online SharePoint tenant you will run into a lot of situations where PowerShell will be the surest way to accomplish your tasks.  This guide doesn't cover SharePoint on-premises, it only attempts to cover some aspects of SharePoint Online administration.

### Permanently deleting a site via PowerShell

```powershell
Remove-SPOSite -Identity https://site.sharepoint.com
Remove-SPODeletedSite -Identity https://site.sharepoint.com
```

> [!Note]
> Make sure you know what you're doing through PowerShell because it won't prompt you.  There might be a way to restore a deleted site but Microsoft would have to be involved.

### Managing Hub Sites

- 2,000 hub sites per tenant
- A modern SharePoint site can be promoted to a Hub site
    - As a team site
    - As a communications site
- Global navigation added automatically
- Configure who is allowed to add sites to the hub
- Can also configure an approval workflow
- Hub site can be registered in the admin center
- Admins can choose who can associate sites with hub - Users, Security Groups, Office 365 Groups
- Hub site can be registed with PowerShell (to make it a hub site)

```powershell
Register-SPOHubSite -Site https://site.sharepoint.com/sites/hubsite -Principals $null
```

To associate other sites to a hub

```powershell
Add-SPOHubSiteAssociation
    -Site https://sites.sharepoint.com/sites/newsite
    -HubSite https://sites.sharepoint/sites/thehub
```

Un-registering a hubsite disconnects it from the hub:

```powershell
Unregister-SPOHubSite -Identity https://sites.sharepoint.com/sites/an-existing-associated-site
```

In the admin center you can go to Active sites and select one site and register as hub site, or associate with a hub.

Un-registering a site as a hub site will disassociate all associated sites with it.

### Managing Hub Navigation

- To do global navigation you have to join sites to the hub
- Navigation management is manual (cannot connect to managed metadata navigation)
- Hub navigation is separate from site navigation
- This PowerShell cmdlet will add Research with the following URL to the top navigation bar:

```powershell
Add-PnPNavigationNode
    -Location TopNavigationBar
    -Title "Research"
    -Url https://site.sharepoint.com/sites/site
```

When doing PowerShell the page cache isn't refreshed, and the navigation is cached.  But if you Edit the menu in the hub site you'll see the change.

### Managing Permissions

There are 4 site permission levels

- Site administrators
- Site owners
- Site members (edit permissions on the site)
- Site visitors - read-only

### Who can assign what?

- Primary/secondary administrators can be assigned in SPO admin center
- Other site administrators can be assigned by primary/secondary admins
- Site owners can be assigned by site administrators
- Site members can be assigned by other site members
- Site visitors can be assigned site members or higher

### Adding site owners and site collection admins using PowerShell:

```powershell
Set-SPOSite
    -Identity https://site.sharepoint.com/sites/thehub
    -Owner jack@smith.com

Set-SPOUser
    -Site https://site.sharepoint.com/sites/thehub
    -LoginName jack@smith.com
    -IsSiteCollectionAdmin $True	
```

### Intro to modern SharePoint info architecture

- No subsites anymore
- Modern SharePoint template
- Managing Hub Sites
- Managing Navigation
- Managing Permissions

### Configuring External Sharing

- At the tenant level
- At the site collection level

### Types of external users

- Authenticated external users (prove you own an email address)
- Anonymous users - anyone via a link (only to specific documents or folders in libraries)

### Types of links

- Anyone - a link that will work anytime by anyone if transferred, can be revoked/cancelled
- People in my organization - a link that will work anytime by people only in our organization (IP restricted?)
- Specific people 
    - A link that's non-transferable, won't work if forwarded
    - Access can be revoked anytime
    - Cannot be shared with anyone other than the specific person (emailed code confirmation)
- A link that's non-transferable won't work if forwarded
- Access can be revoked anytime
- Cannot be shared with anyone other than the specific person (emailed code confirmation)

### External user licensing

- No cost inviting external users in O365 to collab on docs
- Users can read/create/update/delete docs using office online
- Users cannot get the offline desktop client for free (you must assign them a license)

### Sharing docs externally 

- Copy link - creates a link, permissions are shown below (i.e. Anyone with the link can view)
- Can set expiry date - how long a link is valid
- Can set a password when sharing
- Can block download of a file (viewable only in a browser)
- Can create a Microsoft account with any email address to share documents with

In the demo, an external user got access to a SharePoint Online site using his/her Gmail account by creating a Microsoft account using that Gmail address

### Where can we control settings - external sharing

- Tenant level
- Site collection level - more restrictive

### Types of sharing controls

- Internal only
- External authenticated
- Existing external users
- Anonymous
- Limit external by domain
- Can specify a group of people that can share externally
- More settings exist

### Anonymous access links expiration and permissions

- Maximum length until anonymous link expires - 7 days
- Set max permissions for anonymous links
- Files - View, view and edit
- Folders - View, edit, and upload

### Who can share outside your organization

- You can set which users can share externally at two levels
- Only users in selected security groups share with authenticated external users
- Only users in selected security groups share with authenticated external users and using anonymous links
- You can plan governance / training before users are allowed to share.

There are lots of checks that can be implemented to abide by standards.

### Default link type

- Type of link that is created by default when users get a link
- Can limit external sharing by domains (known partners)
- Block specific domains (all allowed except the ones on a list) although "Anyone" links will still be accessible
- Additional settings
    - Prevent external users from sharing items they don't own
    - External users must accept invitations using the same account that invitations were sent to
    - Continue recipients to continually prove account ownership when they access items
    - Customized external sharing policy URL - users trying to share but aren't allowed to

### Notifications

SharePoint can add email address to BCC (i.e. Security team) on all notifications like sharing notifications

Admin center > Policies > Sharing

- External sharing section
- This section is the overall policy that dictates how permissive your SharePoint and OneDrive sharing can be
- SharePoint sharing permissions will need to be more permissive than OneDrive

### Advanced settings

- Allow specific domains list
- Block specific domains list (one or the other)
- Guests must sign in using the same account to which sharing invitations are sent - setting is not enabled by default (but should be)
- Allow guests to share items they don't own - should stay disabled.
