# Deploy from Azure DevOps to On-Premise Environment

With Azure DevOps, you can deploy web or database apps from Azure DevOps to on-premise servers.  No changes to the firewall are required, the servers run the agents that will talk to Azure DevOps and perform any updates.

- Create a build in Azure DevOps
- Create deployment groups on the on-premise servers
- Create the release pipeline

## Create a build

- In DevOps repo, go to Builds and click on New > New build pipeline
- Pick the source repository and the branch
- Pick the ASP.NET template or a specific template to your language code
- Select Build solution (the .sln file)
- For Test filter criteria, set your criteria, i.e. TestCategory=Unit Test
- For the database part, create a Copy files step, and pick the source folder ``${build.sourcedirectory}``, Contents as ``**\bin\${BuildConfiguration}\**`` (the asterisks mean its recursive), and target folder as ``${build.artifactstagingdirectory}``


## Creating deployment groups

- Go to Deployment groups and create a new one
- When you create a deployment group, the Registration script (PowerShell) that shows up is the code that you will need to run on the deployment server to install the agent
- Open a PowerShell window in your deployment target server, and run the PowerShell script
- When you run the PowerShell to create the agent, you'll need the service account to run the agent
- Make sure to select ``Use a personal access token in the script for authentication`` to handle the authentication
- The new target will show up in the Deployment groups in DevOps


## Creating a pipeline

- Pick a deployment group that you've created in the previous step
- You can have a web server and a db server group, both tagged differently, 'web' and 'db' respectively
- Go to Releases and go to ``New release pipeline``
- Select the right pipeline; in this example, the person selected ``IIS website and SQL database deployment``
- Under Stages, call the stage name the ``dev`` for development environment
- Under Artifacts, add an artifact that you've built in the create build phase
- It will fill the source field and populate the default version and source alias, then click Add
- Go to the release pipeline - some info that will need to be set
    - Deployment group: demo
    - Required tags: web (for the web app)
    - Multiple: to deploy to all targets by that tag in parallel
- IIS Web App Manage
    - Unlink some of these fields to make changes
    - Parent website name: give it a name
    - Virtual path: pick the path of the site in the build
    - Physical path authentication: Application User (Pass-through)
    - Advanced settings - explore the settings and adjust accordingly
- IIS Web App Deploy
    - Display name: IIS Web App Deploy
    - Website Name: Default Web Site
    - Virtual Application: your-app-name
    - Package or Folder: ``${System.DefaultWorkingDirectory}\**\*.zip``
    - Advanced settings - here you can transform your connection strings, for example
- SQL Deployment
    - Deployment group: demo
    - Required tags: db
- SQL DB Deploy
    - Display name: SQL DB Deploy
    - Deploy SQL Using: Sql Dacpac
    - DACPAC File: ``${System.DefaultWOrkingDirectory}\**\*.dacpac``
    - Specify SQL Using: Server
    - Server Name: localhost
    - Database Name: your-db-name
    - Authentication: Windows Authentication

That should be it.

- Click Save
- Click Create release, then click Create

The release is created and should be in progress.

## Database deployment process notes

- DevOps world has database projects
- Check in the schema to your source control
- Your source control has source for your app and database schema - all versioned together
- When working on schema, you work in your database project and check it into source control first
- Once database project is checked-in, a pull request may be triggered to do a build
- When the build happens, the build artifact that comes out is called the DACPAC
- DACPAC - schema of the database - flattened to an XML file
- Deploying a database compares the DACPAC and the schema of the production database
- It will then autogenerate scripts needed to make the production database same as the intended new project schema
